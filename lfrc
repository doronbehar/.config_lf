# exit on error and option '-u' is used to give error for unset variables.
# Option '-f' disables pathname expansion which can be useful when $f, $fs, and
# $fx variables contain names with '*' or '?' characters. However, this option
# is used selectively within individual commands as it can be limiting at
# times.
